# AppSentry Development Plan

## Phase 1: Core Reorganization (Week 1)
**Status**: 🚧 In Progress  
**Goal**: Reorganize UI navigation and add basic application management functionality

### 📋 Task Breakdown

#### Backend Development (Priority: High)
- **Task 1.1**: ✅ Add `/health` endpoints to backend and frontend services
  - Backend: `GET /health` endpoint returning `{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}`
  - Frontend: Static health endpoint that checks backend connectivity
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Both services respond with 200 OK and JSON health status

- **Task 1.2**: ✅ Create ClickHouse application registry tables
  - `applications` table with id, name, team, namespace, health_check_url, status, timestamps
  - `health_checks` table with application_id, check_time, status, response_time, error_message
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Tables created with proper schema and can store/retrieve data

- **Task 1.3**: ✅ Create backend API endpoints for application management
  - `POST /api/applications` - Register new application
  - `GET /api/applications` - List all applications with health status
  - `GET /api/applications/:id` - Get application details
  - `PUT /api/applications/:id` - Update application configuration
  - `DELETE /api/applications/:id` - Remove application
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Full CRUD operations working with validation

- **Task 1.4**: ✅ Create backend API endpoints for platform metrics
  - `GET /api/platform/health` - Overall platform health status
  - `GET /api/platform/metrics` - Node CPU, memory, pod counts
  - `GET /api/platform/events` - Recent platform events
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Real K8s metrics data returned via API

#### Frontend Development (Priority: High)
- **Task 1.5**: ✅ Reorganize frontend navigation structure
  - Update main navigation to include Dashboard, Monitor, Manage, Platform sections
  - Ensure existing OTEL components still accessible
  - Add proper routing for new sections
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Navigation works, all existing features accessible

- **Task 1.6**: ✅ Create new Dashboard page with mission control layout
  - Platform Health section (CPU, Memory, Network, Error Rate)
  - Application Health section (Apps Up/Down, SLA)
  - Recent Events section (alerts, failures, deployments)
  - Quick Actions section (Add App, Run Checks, View Alerts)
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Dashboard displays real data from APIs

- **Task 1.7**: ✅ Move existing OTEL components to Monitor section
  - Traces page under Monitor → Traces
  - Metrics page under Monitor → Metrics  
  - Logs page under Monitor → Logs
  - Ensure all functionality preserved
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: All OTEL features work in new location

- **Task 1.8**: ✅ Create Applications management page
  - Application grid view with status indicators
  - Add new application form
  - Application detail view with health history
  - Filter by team, status, environment
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Can manage applications end-to-end

#### Integration & State Management (Priority: Medium)
- **Task 1.9**: ✅ Implement React Context + useReducer for state management
  - Create AppContext for global state
  - Manage application list, platform status, user preferences
  - Ensure performance with proper memoization
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: State shared across components, no prop drilling

- **Task 1.10**: ✅ Add K8s API integration for platform metrics
  - Connect to K8s API from backend
  - Collect node and pod metrics
  - Handle API failures gracefully
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Real K8s data flows to dashboard

#### Testing & Demo Prep (Priority: Medium/Low)
- **Task 1.11**: ✅ Create demo Node.js application for realistic testing
  - Simple Express app with health endpoint
  - Deploy to Minikube
  - Include intentional health issues for testing
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Third application to monitor beyond frontend/backend

- **Task 1.12**: ✅ Implement health check scheduler
  - Background service to check application health every 30 seconds
  - Store results in ClickHouse
  - Update application status based on results
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Health status automatically updates

- **Task 1.13**: ✅ Add error handling for degraded states
  - Handle ClickHouse connection failures
  - Handle K8s API unavailable scenarios
  - Show degraded status in UI
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: System graceful under failure conditions

- **Task 1.14**: ✅ Test end-to-end data flow with real applications
  - Register AppSentry frontend/backend as applications
  - Verify health checks working
  - Verify platform metrics collection
  - Verify dashboard updates
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Complete data flow working with real services

### 🎯 Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard shows real platform and application health data
- [ ] Application management (CRUD) fully functional
- [ ] All existing OTEL features preserved and accessible
- [ ] Navigation intuitive and organized
- [ ] Health checks running automatically
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance acceptable (dashboard loads < 2 seconds)
